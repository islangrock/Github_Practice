Practice making a pull request!!! 

On your local machine, create a *new* markdown file that includes:  
1. Your favorite color
2. The last book you read or what you are currently reading 
3. A TV or Movie Recommendation 
4. Choose one: Donut or Croissant?? Can I have both?

Save the file with your name as the file name! 

Create a branch of the repository (name it whatever) and then add, commit, and push your new file to the remote repository. 

Then find your branch and open up a pull request!
